      Since tremendous growth of data, processing data become a vital part of developers. I would like to do research, design and development using cutting edge technologies which market needs in coming years. For this, I would like to access like free public streaming API and need to process the data using an event processor using Java Application and place the data into Kafka cluster. Later I would like to process the data in NoSQL database using any ETL tool and, I would like to do a Kafka stream to get metrices of the data we received. An then using Spring boot application, I would like to expose the data to Angular front-end application. In other hand, I would like to implement an alerting system using Node.js or Python to create alerts for events using email alert.
